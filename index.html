                Messi began his career with FC Barcelona and stayed at the Spanish club until joining Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in 2021.After a troubled two-year stint at the French club, he signed for Major League Soccer’s Inter Miami in June.Messi was part of the Inter Miami team that won the 2023 League Cup and the PSG team that won the 2022-23 French Super Cup. But he etched his legacy in club football during his 21-year association with Barcelona.Over the course of 778 games with the club, Messi scored 672 goals, ahead of Brazil great Pele, who scored 643 goals while playing for Santos. At Barcelona, Messi leads Cesar Rodriguez, who scored 446 goals for the Spanish giants.
